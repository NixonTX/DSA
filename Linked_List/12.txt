// Linked List

/* 
Array: wastage of memory ; Solution for this problem :- L.L.

Types:
1.) Singly LL       2.) Doubly LL
3.) Circular LL     4.) Doubly Circular LL


Array vs Linked List
LL : Accessing depends on no.of nodes.
ex, If you want to access the element in the middle, you have to go through all nodes before that.

Data accessing, Array is better than LL

Memory utilization is efficient in LL.
In Array there is memory wastage. 

Memory requirement in Array is less
Memory requirement in LL is more.

Array : Linear & Binary Search is possible.
LL    : Only Linear search is possible.
