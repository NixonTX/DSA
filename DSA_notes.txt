Efficiency : Time & Space
Performance == scale
Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.

Time Complexit : Time Complexity considers how many times each statement executes. 
Time complexity is a way to measure how long an algorithm takes to run based on the size of its input. 
Time complexity is not the actual time required to execute the code, the actual time required to execute code is machine-dependent
